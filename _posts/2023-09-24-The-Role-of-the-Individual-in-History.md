title: The Role of the Individual in History - Inspired by 'War and Peace'
---

Leo Tolstoy's monumental work, [War and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace), grapples with the complex relationship between individual actions and the grand tapestry of history. Tolstoy argues that history tends to focus on "Great Men" like Napoleon, often neglecting the countless individuals who also shape events.

### Individual Will vs. Historical Forces

I find Tolstoy's perspective compelling, especially the idea that history often overlooks the myriad contributions of ordinary individuals. However, I also believe that individuals like Napoleon, or contemporary leaders such as [Narendra Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi) in India and [Mahathir Mohamad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad) in Malaysia, possess a unique ability to exert their will in ways that are not solely dictated by their sociopolitical contexts; therefore, Tolstoy's argument almost resolves these Ãœbermensches of their failings. These individuals navigate the constraints of their environments, but they also act according to their personal convictions and ambitions.

### The Complexity of Individual Agency

Leaders are not just passive products of their times; they also possess the agency to shape their circumstances. The decisions they make are influenced by a blend of personal ambition, cultural norms, and political savvy. These decisions can, in turn, create ripples that significantly impact their societies and even alter the course of history. Leaders are more than just chess pieces moved by the hand of fate; they are also players in their own right.

### The Duality of Influence

The relationship between a leader and their environment is reciprocal. While a leader is molded by their upbringing and societal values, they also have the power to influence these very factors. This duality makes them neither entirely autonomous nor mere products of their circumstances. Instead, they are complex figures who engage in a dynamic interplay with the world around them.

### Modern Examples

Narendra Modi and Mahathir Mohamad serve as contemporary examples of leaders who have exhibited their will in ways that have sparked controversy and criticism. Modi, the Prime Minister of India, has been implicated in a deeply troubling international incident. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has accused "agents of the Indian government" of assassinating a Sikh separatist, a Canadian citizen, on Canadian soil. This allegation has strained relations between India and Canada, and it also places U.S. diplomatic efforts in a precarious position, given the U.S.'s attempts to foster closer ties with India. The incident raises ethical and legal questions about the extent of Modi's influence and the means by which he wields it.

On the other hand, Mahathir Mohamad's long tenure as Malaysia's Prime Minister is tainted by allegations of corruption and authoritarianism. His governance has been criticized for a blatant disregard for democratic values and human rights. The legacy he leaves behind is one that has been overshadowed by these controversies, making it difficult to attribute his influence to anything other than his own questionable decisions.

Both leaders, in their own ways, have shown that the will of an individual can significantly impact not just their country, but also international relations. However, the ways in which they have exerted their influence have led to ethical and diplomatic quandaries that cannot be ignored.


### Conclusion

In conclusion, while Tolstoy's "War and Peace" offers a compelling critique of the "Great Man" theory of history, the reality is more nuanced. Individuals do have the capacity to shape and be shaped by history. Their actions, though constrained by their environments, are also guided by their personal beliefs and aspirations.
